**"Active members (3m)"** or **"members returning for action in the last 3 months"** are defined as those members who 
took an action in the last that wasn't their joining action. 

E.g., if someone signs a new petition and becomes thereby a new member of our list, they are not an active member yet. Once they sign a second action, they are active. If that second action is more than 3 months ago, they are not active anymore. (This is the definition for membership in the active member group.) 

For the stats, we actually use a slightly different approach: To make the curve more smooth and prevent random jumps down on the graph, we actually define a degree to which a member is active. One member counts as 1.0 active members if the last action is less than 2 months ago, as 0.5 active members if the last action is 3 months ago, and as 0.0 active members if the action is more than 4 months ago. (And at intermediate numbers in between, e.g., last action 3.5 months ago = 0.25 active member.)
