Latest activities from the pas 48 hours.
By default, it's filtered on the activities today, but you can change that.

The color on the left hand column is the same as the line. The ones that have a background are the new signatures and total signatures (new member+existing member+pending+optout).
The statues for the signatures are:
- **completed new** (new members that opted-in)
- **re(activated)** member that took their first action since 3 months
- **existing** active members that signed
- **pending** we sent the consent email, they haven't replied (opted in or opted out)
- **optout(not joining)** new signatories that opted out joining wemove (didn't become a member)
- **share** people that clicked one of the share button

The percentages on the left hand column are compared to the number of signatures.
