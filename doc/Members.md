By default, this dataviz shows all our members as of today. On the left hand column, you can select another group (only the [donors](/civicrm/dataviz/members/1851), [recurring donors](/civicrm/dataviz/members/1852)...).

You can filter them by:
- date (when they joined)
- by language
- where they came from (the campaign)
- their country (based on what they chose)

# date
The date graph at the top shows when the members of today entered the database. ie. if you read 500'000 members in december, it does not mean we had half a million members in december, but that on the members today, 500k were already known in December, even if some of them were not members. 

# Campaign type and campaign

you have two graphs related to the origin 
- a pie chart with the type of campaign (you.wemove vs act.wemove, vs ECI partner)
- a bar chart where you can either select specific campaigns or type the campaign you want
